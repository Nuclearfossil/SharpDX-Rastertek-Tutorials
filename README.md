# SharpDX Rastertek Tutorials Series I
  Install Link: <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan6040/SharpDX-Rastertek-Tutorials/master/SharpDXWinForm/publish/setup.exe>Install WinForms (x86) Edition Executable of This Repo (Published Updates)</a>
  
This is a C# repository based off the Rastertek Tutorial Series posted on www.Rastertek.com, is a literal conversion of the C++ implementations posted on the WebSite, to a .NET C# based implementation using SharpDX 3.0.2, DirectX 11 &amp; WinForms. 
This is intended for C# developers to use as a reference when trying to learn DirectX 11 3D programming, especially when most examples using DirectX are written in C++, so this repo is mimiking ALOT of common C++ DirectX style code writing but in your favorite language C#! So please unless you find an error its not intended for new contributions, its easy to run these tutorials as I have included a Winforms UI for executing every Tutorial example found on www.Rastertek.com. Enjoy!.


** Notes:  All Screenshots were taken from this codes execution in C# so what you see is what you will get!. As well as All Performance Test Results in Frames Per Second, were run off my Desktop HP System., that only has DirectX 10.1, and all screen sizes were recorded in 800x600 for both the C++ and C# implementations.

This Tutorial uses DirectInput for allowing you control of the mouse by moving a small bitmap representing the mouse pointer, and when clicked its tested whether or not the mouse pointer was over a 3D Sphere object or not and reports it on screen using SharpDX.

This Tutorial renders a beautiful tree using an array of textures and while the light sets over the tree like the sun, it projects the shodow of the tree against the 3D Fllor that is textured as well, and all leaves are individually projected as part of the trees shadow as well, and very impressive too using SharpDX.

This Tutorial demonstrated a technique that is used when you want more then 8 light sources rendered on any given scene. Eight lights is a DirectX11 limitation that when using the GPU for shading, only 8 light positions can be processed realtime, so this is rendering the lighting and then as an additional step placing that rendering on a texture and placing that texture on a 3D Cube using SharpDX.
