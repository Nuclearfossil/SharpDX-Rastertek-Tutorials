# SharpDX Rastertek Tutorials Series I
This is a C# repository based off the Rastertek Tutorial Series posted on www.Rastertek.com, is a literal conversion of the C++ iimplementations posted on the WebSite, to a .NET C# based implementation using SharpDX 2.6.3, DirectX 11 &amp; WinForms..


** Note:  All Performance Test Results in Frames Per Second, were run off my Desktop HP System., that only has DirectX 10.1, and all screen sizes were recorded in 800x600 for both the C++ and C# implementations.
